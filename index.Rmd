## Bio

Add a photo 

I am a lecturer in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Queensland University of Technology. My research interests are in statistical climatology with a primary focus is on modelling climate extremes; and understanding how the probability of extreme events might be influenced by climate change. Other interests include; statistical post-processing of meteorological forecasts, quality control of meteorological data and how to estimate the risk posed by compound weather events. Kateâ€™s research improves our understanding of the probability of extreme climate/weather events and helps us to make informed decisions about natural disaster risk.
